## Welcome to my blog



Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Introducing myself

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
what are you looking for ....

# hello
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```


### Thank you 

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/wellknownalpha/github-pages-with-jekyll/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
